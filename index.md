# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...
Dr.Jordan B. Peterson.

Some of the things he said have impacted so many lives around the world. 
Some of them are:-
1. Be happy for people when they share good news with you.
2. Treat yourself like you matter and treat other people like they matter aswell.
3. Its not okay where you are. You're nowhere near wht you could be.
4. So you are a mess, You can do something about it
5. Do not cast pearls before swine - When people are not listening to you, stop talking to them because they are devaulng what you have to say. And if you find people who listen, talk to them.
6. If you're a monster and you don't act monstrously, youre virtous.
7. Make your bed - Act in a manner that produces order - compounding effect of positive things you can do.
8. If you dont have enough meaning in your life, youre more prone to addiction
9. Make a schedule - set it uo as the best possible day
10. Figure out what you want in your life/ what would be good for you
11. Reorient your life in every possible way to make the probability that would occur as certain as possible - Sacrificial idea.
12. Sit up on your bed one day and ask yourself, 'what remarkably stupid things am I doing on a regular basis to absolutely screw up my life?
13. If you exposed yourself to the things that you are afriad of or avoiding in the past 2 - 5 years, what would your life be like.
14. You are a node in network - The things you do are like dropping a stone in a pond, the ripples effect outwordly. The things you do and dont do are far more important than you think.
